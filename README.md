# PCRemoteServer
This is the server side of the PCRemote app for Windows that allows your phone to connect to your computer.
It will run in the tray once started, connect to your phone and then execute mouse and keyboard commands via the Java robots class.
The right click menu shows your computer's Bluetooth MAC address so you can input it on your phone to connect to your PC.
